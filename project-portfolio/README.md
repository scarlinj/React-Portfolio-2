# Stephen's React Portfolio

This is a website launched entirely through React. Click the links at the top to see pages about me, my portfolio and how to contact me. This was all built in React!

## Features

This is a single-page application portfolio for a web developer. When you load the portfolio, then I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer. When viewing the header, you will see the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio. View the navigation to see the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, with the title corresponding to the current section highlighted. When you click on a navigation title, the site presents the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.

When loading the portfolio the first time, the About Me title and section are selected by default. This shows the About Me section, where you will see a photo of me and a short bio. The Portfolio section shows titled images of six of the Stephen's applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository. The Contact section provides a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message. When moving the cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, you will receive a notification that this field is required. When you enter text into the email address field, you receive a notification if you have entered an invalid email address.

When navigating to the Resume section, then you see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developerâ€™s proficiencies.

When you view the footer, then you will see text or icon links to the Stephen's GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, as well as his profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter).

## About the Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To bootstrap the application, rather than creating from scratch, navigate to the root folder and install with: "npx create-react-app project-portfolio"

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
